            <p>Here's what Dario Sosa Cabrera, a marine technologies engineer and entrepreneur (and the cofounder and maker of LPA Fabrika: Gran Canaria Maker Space) has to say about Luis:
                "He is very enthusiastic and an engineer in multiple disciplines. He is responsible for his work. He can manage himself and can take up responsibilities as a team leader,
                as demonstrated at the euRathlon competition. His background in electronics and telecommunications allows him to cover a wide range of expertise from signal processing and software,
                to electronic design and fabrication."</p>
            <p>First, I have to acknowledge Aaron, Anil, and Enrique for inviting me to participate in this book. It has been a pleasure to return to work with them. Also, I want to thank the Subsea Mechatronics
                team for the great experience working with heavy underwater robots, we grew together during these years. I have to mention LPA Fabrika
                â€“ Gran Canaria Maker Space for the enthusiasm preparing and teaching educational robotics and technological projects; sharing a workspace with kids can be really motivating</p>
